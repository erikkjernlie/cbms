# Types

The files in this folder contain interfaces that represent *objects* used repeatedly in the code. Defining interfaces for these objects ensures code consistency and makes it easier to debug code. The interfaces are imported in the files where they are used.

They are divided into the following categories according to use: 

* Datahandling
* Datasource
* Index
* Project
