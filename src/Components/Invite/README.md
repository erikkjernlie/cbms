# Invite

The invite component displays a textinput where the user can enter an email address of an existing user to invite it to take part in the project. An invitation is sent to the user with the email address and popus up as a toaster. The receiving user can accept, show or ignore the invitation. If the invite is accepted, the project is added to the projects of that user.
